  <strong>Figure 1:</strong> (a) Map of China. (b) Zoomed-in map of the BTH region along with locations of $68$ monitoring stations (red dots) and centroids of $5{,}587$ 9-km CMAQ grids (gray dots).} (c)-(e) Scatter plots of CMAQ $PM_{2.5}$ forecasts versus actual observations at Zhangjiakou, Beijing, and Hengshui in different seasons, {where ``Corr'' represents the Pearson correlation coefficient between CMAQ $PM_{2.5}$ outputs and observed $PM_{2.5}$ concentrations. Three reference lines with the slope k = 0.5, 1, and  2 are colored in gray.
