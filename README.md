Numerical air quality models, such as the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) system, play a critical role in characterizing pollution levels at fine spatial and temporal scales. The model outputs, however, tend to systematically over- or under-estimate the real pollutant concentrations. In this study, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical model to calibrate large-scale grid-level CMAQ model outputs, using point-level observations from sparsely-located monitoring stations. In deep hierarchies of our model, a flexible quantification of uncertainties is employed to describe the dynamic nature of air pollutions. In addition, we adopt several techniques such as variational Bayes and ensemble Kalman smoother to speed up the whole calibration procedure. We apply the proposed model to calibrate CMAQ model outputs for China's Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. In contrast to existing methods, our model is able to capture space-time interactions, produce more accurate calibration results and operates at a higher computational efficiency.
